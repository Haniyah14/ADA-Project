Project: Implementing and Exploring Hyperdeterminant-Based Solutions for Homogeneous Multilinear Equations

This project will involve a combination of theoretical understanding, algorithm design, software development, and experimental analysis. We will start by diving into the mathematical concepts of hyperdeterminants and multilinear algebra. Then, we will proceed to implement the algorithms described in the paper, with a focus on efficiency and correctness. Finally, we will apply our implementation to a specific problem to showcase its potential.
